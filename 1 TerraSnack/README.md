# Snack Game Deployment with Terraform on AWS S3

Welcome to the Snack Game deployment repository! This project allows you to deploy the Snack Game onto AWS S3 using Terraform for infrastructure automation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy the Snack Game:

### Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI:** Ensure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials.
  
### Steps

1. **Clone this Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maunikms/terrafrom-projects.git
   cd snack-game-deployment
   ```

2. **Modify Bucket Name (Optional):**
   Open the `variables.tf` file and edit the `bucket_name` variable to set a unique name for your S3 bucket.
   ```hcl
   variable "bucket_name" {
     description = "Name of the S3 bucket for hosting the Snack Game"
     default     = "your-unique-bucket-name"
   }
   ```

3. **Connect with AWS CLI:**
   Make sure your AWS CLI is properly configured with the required permissions.

4. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Plan the Deployment:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

6. **Deploy to AWS S3:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will initiate the deployment of the Snack Game code to an AWS S3 bucket.

### Accessing the Game

Once the deployment is successful, access the Snack Game through the following URL: [Your-S3-Bucket-URL](#)

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up in your AWS environment for the deployment to succeed.
- Modify the `bucket_name` variable in the `variables.tf` file to customize the S3 bucket name as per your preference.
